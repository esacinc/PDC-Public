      <h4>Intellectual Property policy statement</h4>
      <p>Users of PDC shall acknowledge that they are encouraged not to acquire ownership interest in PDC data, nor any immediate or future intellectual property rights in any research conducted using the PDC data. NIH considers these data as pre-competitive and urges Users to avoid making IP claims derived directly from the proteomic dataset(s). It is expected that these NIH-provided data, and conclusions derived therefore, will remain freely available, without requirement for licensing. However, the NIH also recognizes the importance of the subsequent development of IP on downstream discoveries, especially in therapeutics, which will be necessary to support full investment in products that the public needs. For further information about the PDC Intellectual Property policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:PDCHelpDesk@mail.nih.gov?Subject=PDC Help" class="custom-link">PDCHelpDesk&#64;mail.nih.gov</a>.</p>
